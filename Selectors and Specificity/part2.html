Create snips of HTML in this document or a separate HTML document that demonstrate what the below selectors would style. Do not write an entire HTML document – just the relevant snip is fine. Obviously there are many answers to this problem! Make sure your HTML is valid.

For example, given:

ul li a
You might write:

<ul>
    <li><a href=”mylink.html”>My link</a></li>
</ul>


The deliverable for Part 2 is a text file called part2.txt. Number each HTML snip that you generate with the problem below. Add this to your zip file to turn in, as described in “how to submit your assignment” below.
