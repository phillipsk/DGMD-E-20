        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <div class="separate">
        <p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised... - Luke 4:18</p>
        <p>We believe the Bible, composed of the sixty­six books of the Old and New Testaments, is
            God’s inspired and infallible Word. It is inerrant in the original manuscripts, and is the
            authority on all matters of life, belief, and practice of our faith.</p>
        <p>We believe in one God, maker of heaven and earth, and eternally existent as God the Father,
            God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit; equal in divine perfection, and executing distinct but
            harmonious offices in the great work of redemption. He is pure, holy, all­powerful, full of
            love, and the source of truth.</p>
        <p>We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ. We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten of the
            Holy Ghost in a miraculous manner; born of Mary, a virgin, as no other man was ever born
            or can ever be born of a woman, and that He is the Son of God, and God, the Son. We
            believe in His sinless life, and in His miracles. His death on the cross was substitutionary for mankind and paid for the sins of the world. He died, was buried, rose bodily from the grave,
            He ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of God the Father, is the only mediator
            between God and man, and He will return to earth in power and glory.</p>

            <h3>Full Deliverance For All!</h3>
            <div class="separate">
            <p>We believe God is the initiator of reconciliation with us and that the blessings of salvation
                are made free to all by the gospel. However, His holiness demands justice for the wrongs we
                have done. We believe that salvation is bestowed not in consideration of any works of
                righteousness which we have done; but solely through faith in the sacrifice of Jesus to atone
                for our sin and satisfy God’s wrath against sin. We believe that salvation is instantaneous and
                not a process; that in the new birth the one dead in trespasses and in sins is made a partaker
                of the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God; that the new creation is not
                brought about by the will of man, but by the will of God. We believe that Repentance and
                Faith are solemn obligations, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the Spirit
                of God; thereby, being deeply convicted of our guilt, danger and helplessness, and of the way
                of salvation by Christ, we turn to God with sincere remorse, confession and plea for mercy;
                at the same time heartily receiving the Lord Jesus Christ and openly confessing Him as our
                only and all­sufficient Savior and Lord. We believe that nothing prevents the salvation of the
                greatest sinner on earth but his own inherent depravity and voluntary rejection of the gospel;
                which rejection involves him in an aggravated condemnation.</p>

        <h3>The Church</h3>
        <div class="separate">
        <p>We believe that the Church, the body of Christ, is made up of all believers of the church age;
            that Jesus Christ is the head of the Church; and that local churches are the practical
            expression of the Church. The local Church is a “people who” rather than a “place where”.
            Therefore, the church is the gathering of those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ,
            have been baptized, associated by a covenant of faith and who meet for the purpose of being
            a church. Members of a local church voluntarily share their lives and faith with each other in
            unity and meet together for encouragement, worship, service, prayer, spiritual development
            and to observe the ordinances of the church (baptism by immersion and communion). We
            hold that the local church has the absolute right of self government, free from the interference
            of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations; that every church is the sole and only judge
            of the measure and method of its cooperation; on all matters of membership, of policy, of
            government, of discipline, and of benevolence. We believe the local church is the planned
            instrument of God to carry out the Great Commission. Therefore, we believe every believer
            should join a local church and fully engage in accomplishing its mission.l</p>
